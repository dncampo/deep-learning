having been at home or at least guests in many realms of the spirit having escaped again and again from the gloomy agreeable nooks in which preferences and prejudices youth origin the accident of men and books or even the weariness of travel seemed to confine us full of malice against the seductions of dependency which he concealed in honours money positions or exaltation of the senses grateful even for distress and the vicissitudes of illness because they always free us from some rule and its  prejudice  grateful to the god devil sheep and worm in us inquisitive to a fault investigators to the point of cruelty with unhesitating fingers for the intangible with teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible ready for any business that requires sagacity and acute senses ready for every adventure owing to an excess of  free will  with anterior and posterior souls into the ultimate intentions of which it is difficult to pry with foregrounds and backgrounds to the end of which no foot may run hidden ones under the mantles of light appropriators although we resemble heirs and spendthrifts arrangers and collectors from morning till night misers of our wealth and our full crammed drawers economical in learning and forgetting inventive in scheming sometimes proud of tables of categories sometimes pedants sometimes night owls of work even in full day yea if necessary even scarecrows  and it is necessary nowadays that is to say inasmuch as we are the born sworn jealous friends of solitude of our own profoundest midnight and midday solitude  such kind of men are we we free spirits and perhaps ye are also something of the same kind ye coming ones ye new philosophers chapter iii

one has to thank them for invaluable services and who is sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation of all that the  spiritual men  of christianity have done for europe hitherto but when they had given comfort to the sufferers courage to the oppressed and despairing a staff and support to the helpless and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual penitentiaries the broken hearted and distracted what else had they to do in order to work systematically in that fashion and with a good conscience for the preservation of all the sick and suffering which means in deed and in truth to work for the deterioration of the european race to reverse all estimates of value  that is what they had to do and to shatter the strong to spoil great hopes to cast suspicion on the delight in beauty to break down everything autonomous manly conquering and imperious  all instincts which are natural to the highest and most successful type of  man   into uncertainty distress of conscience and self destruction forsooth to invert all love of the earthly and of supremacy over the earth into hatred of the earth and earthly things  that is the task the church imposed on itself and was obliged to impose until according to its standard of value  unworldliness   unsensuousness  and  higher man  fused into one sentiment

apparently in opposition to the peacefully industrious democrats and revolution ideologues and still more so to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity visionaries who call themselves socialists and want a  free society  those are really at one with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form of society other than that of the autonomous herd to the extent even of repudiating the notions  master  and  servant   ni dieu ni maitre says a socialist formula at one in their tenacious opposition to every special claim every special right and privilege this means ultimately opposition to every right for when all are equal no one needs  rights  any longer at one in their distrust of punitive justice as though it were a violation of the weak unfair to the necessary consequences of all former society but equally at one in their religion of sympathy in their compassion for all that feels lives and suffers down to the very animals up even to  god   the extravagance of  sympathy for god  belongs to a democratic age altogether at one in the cry and impatience of their sympathy in their deadly hatred of suffering generally in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or allowing it at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart softening under the spell of which europe seems to be threatened with a new buddhism at one in their belief in the morality of mutual sympathy as though it were morality in itself the climax the attained climax of mankind the sole hope of the future the consolation of the present the great discharge from all the obligations of the past altogether at one in their belief in the community as the deliverer in the herd and therefore in  themselves

however gratefully one may welcome the objective spirit  and who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded ipsisimosity  in the end however one must learn caution even with regard to one's gratitude and put a stop to the exaggeration with which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been celebrated as if it were the goal in itself as if it were salvation and glorification  as is especially accustomed to happen in the pessimist school which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the highest honours to  disinterested knowledge  the objective man who no longer curses and scolds like the pessimist the ideal man of learning in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand complete and partial failures is assuredly one of the most costly instruments that exist but his place is in the hand of one who is more powerful he is only an instrument we may say he is a mirror  he is no  purpose in himself  the objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed to prostration before everything that wants to be known with such desires only as knowing or  reflecting  implies  he waits until something comes and then expands himself sensitively so that even the light footsteps and gliding past of spiritual beings may not be lost on his surface and film whatever  personality  he still possesses seems to him accidental arbitrary or still oftener disturbing so much has he come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms and events he calls up the recollection of  himself  with an effort and not infrequently wrongly he readily confounds himself with other persons he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs and here only is he unrefined and negligent perhaps he is troubled about the health or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend or the lack of companions and society  indeed he sets himself to reflect on his suffering but in vain his thoughts already rove away to the more general case and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how to help himself he does not now take himself seriously and devote time to himself he is serene not from lack of trouble but from lack of capacity for grasping and dealing with his trouble the habitual complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences the radiant and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that comes his way his habit of inconsiderate good nature of dangerous indifference as to yea and nay alas there are enough of cases in which he has to atone for these virtues of his  and as man generally he becomes far too easily the caput mortuum of such virtues

that however which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the will they are no longer familiar with independence of decision or the courageous feeling of pleasure in willing  they are doubtful of the  freedom of the will  even in their dreams our present day europe the scene of a senseless precipitate attempt at a radical blending of classes and consequently of races is therefore skeptical in all its heights and depths sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch sometimes with gloomy aspect like a cloud over charged with interrogative signs  and often sick unto death of its will paralysis of will where do we not find this cripple sitting nowadays and yet how bedecked oftentimes' how seductively ornamented there are the finest gala dresses and disguises for this disease and that for instance most of what places itself nowadays in the show cases as  objectiveness   the scientific spirit   l'art pour l'art  and  pure voluntary knowledge  is only decked out skepticism and paralysis of will  i am ready to answer for this diagnosis of the european disease  the disease of the will is diffused unequally over europe it is worst and most varied where civilization has longest prevailed it decreases according as  the barbarian  still  or again  asserts his claims under the loose drapery of western culture it is therefore in the france of today as can be readily disclosed and comprehended that the will is most infirm and france which has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over europe by being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism the power to will and to persist moreover in a resolution is already somewhat stronger in germany and again in the north of germany it is stronger than in central germany it is considerably stronger in england spain and corsica associated with phlegm in the former and with hard skulls in the latter  not to mention italy which is too young yet to know what it wants and must first show whether it can exercise will but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense middle empire where europe as it were flows back to asia  namely in russia there the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated there the will  uncertain whether to be negative or affirmative  waits threateningly to be discharged to borrow their pet phrase from our physicists perhaps not only indian wars and complications in asia would be necessary to free europe from its greatest danger but also internal subversion the shattering of the empire into small states and above all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility together with the obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast i do not say this as one who desires it in my heart i should rather prefer the contrary  i mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of russia that europe would have to make up its mind to become equally threatening  namely to acquire one will by means of a new caste to rule over the continent a persistent dreadful will of its own that can set its aims thousands of years ahead so that the long spun out comedy of its petty statism and its dynastic as well as its democratic many willed ness might finally be brought to a close

they have always disclosed how much hypocrisy indolence self indulgence and self neglect how much falsehood was concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality how much virtue was outlived they have always said  we must remove hence to where you are least at home  in the face of a world of  modern ideas  which would like to confine every one in a corner in a  specialty  a philosopher if there could be philosophers nowadays would be compelled to place the greatness of man the conception of  greatness  precisely in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness in his all roundness he would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety of that which a man could bear and take upon himself according to the extent to which a man could stretch his responsibility nowadays the taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will nothing is so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently in the ideal of the philosopher strength of will sternness and capacity for prolonged resolution must specially be included in the conception of  greatness  with as good a right as the opposite doctrine with its ideal of a silly renouncing humble selfless humanity was suited to an opposite age  such as the sixteenth century which suffered from its accumulated energy of will and from the wildest torrents and floods of selfishness in the time of socrates among men only of worn out instincts old conservative athenians who let themselves go   for the sake of happiness  as they said for the sake of pleasure as their conduct indicated  and who had continually on their lips the old pompous words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led irony was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul the wicked socratic assurance of the old physician and plebeian who cut ruthlessly into his own flesh as into the flesh and heart of the  noble  with a look that said plainly enough  do not dissemble before me here  we are equal  at present on the contrary when throughout europe the herding animal alone attains to honours and dispenses honours when  equality of right  can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong  i mean to say into general war against everything rare strange and privileged against the higher man the higher soul the higher duty the higher responsibility the creative plenipotence and lordliness  at present it belongs to the conception of  greatness  to be noble to wish to be apart to be capable of being different to stand alone to have to live by personal initiative and the philosopher will betray something of his own ideal when he asserts  he shall be the greatest who can be the most solitary the most concealed the most divergent the man beyond good and evil the master of his virtues and of super abundance of will precisely this shall be called greatness as diversified as can be entire as ample as can be full

you want if possible  and there is not a more foolish  if possible   to do away with suffering and we  it really seems that we would rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been well being as you understand it  is certainly not a goal it seems to us an end a condition which at once renders man ludicrous and contemptible  and makes his destruction desirable the discipline of suffering of great suffering  know ye not that it is only this discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto the tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energy its shuddering in view of rack and ruin its inventiveness and bravery in undergoing enduring interpreting and exploiting misfortune and whatever depth mystery disguise spirit artifice or greatness has been bestowed upon the soul  has it not been bestowed through suffering through the discipline of great suffering in man creature and creator are united in man there is not only matter shred excess clay mire folly chaos but there is also the creator the sculptor the hardness of the hammer the divinity of the spectator and the seventh day  do ye understand this contrast and that your sympathy for the  creature in man  applies to that which has to be fashioned bruised forged stretched roasted annealed refined  to that which must necessarily suffer and is meant to suffer and our sympathy  do ye not understand what our reverse sympathy applies to when it resists your sympathy as the worst of all pampering and enervation  so it is sympathy against sympathy  but to repeat it once more there are higher problems than the problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy and all systems of philosophy which deal only with these are naivetes

they are akin fundamentally akin in all the heights and depths of their requirements it is europe the one europe whose soul presses urgently and longingly outwards and upwards in their multifarious and boisterous art  whither into a new light towards a new sun but who would attempt to express accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not express distinctly it is certain that the same storm and stress tormented them that they sought in the same manner these last great seekers all of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ears  the first artists of universal literary culture  for the most part even themselves writers poets intermediaries and blenders of the arts and the senses wagner as musician is reckoned among painters as poet among musicians as artist generally among actors all of them fanatics for expression  at any cost   i specially mention delacroix the nearest related to wagner all of them great discoverers in the realm of the sublime also of the loathsome and dreadful still greater discoverers in effect in display in the art of the show shop all of them talented far beyond their genius out and out virtuosi with mysterious accesses to all that seduces allures constrains and upsets born enemies of logic and of the straight line hankering after the strange the exotic the monstrous the crooked and the self contradictory as men tantaluses of the will plebeian parvenus who knew themselves to be incapable of a noble tempo or of a lento in life and action  think of balzac for instance  unrestrained workers almost destroying themselves by work antinomians and rebels in manners ambitious and insatiable without equilibrium and enjoyment all of them finally shattering and sinking down at the christian cross and with right and reason for who of them would have been sufficiently profound and sufficiently original for an anti christian philosophy  on the whole a boldly daring splendidly overbearing high flying and aloft up dragging class of higher men who had first to teach their century  and it is the century of the masses  the conception  higher man

the genius of the heart as that great mysterious one possesses it the tempter god and born rat catcher of consciences whose voice can descend into the nether world of every soul who neither speaks a word nor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch of allurement to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how to appear  not as he is but in a guise which acts as an additional constraint on his followers to press ever closer to him to follow him more cordially and thoroughly  the genius of the heart which imposes silence and attention on everything loud and self conceited which smoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longing  to lie placid as a mirror that the deep heavens may be reflected in them  the genius of the heart which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate and to grasp more delicately which scents the hidden and forgotten treasure the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark ice and is a divining rod for every grain of gold long buried and imprisoned in mud and sand the genius of the heart from contact with which every one goes away richer not favoured or surprised not as though gratified and oppressed by the good things of others but richer in himself newer than before broken up blown upon and sounded by a thawing wind more uncertain perhaps more delicate more fragile more bruised but full of hopes which as yet lack names full of a new will and current full of a new ill will and counter current
